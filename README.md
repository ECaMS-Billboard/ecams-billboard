# ECaMS Billboard
ECaMS Billboard is a full-stack web application based on MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Tailwind CSS. It is under very active development by Lewis University students in the Software Systems Capstone (CPSC-49200) course.

It serves as a general informational platform for students, with the central feature of enabling campus organizations to advertise about upcoming events.

Presently, the project maintains one kiosk in the AS building (S hallway), but will tentatively be expanded to include multiple devices across different locations.
